### Active lives and falls in older adults
An anlysis of area level factors influencing activity levels in older adults with a view to implementing targeted interventions to prevent falls.

#### Summary:
Results show older adults’ lower activity is spatially clustered in deprived, urban LSOAs and in areas with higher proportions of carers and single-occupant households.
Rural areas have different challenges with limited access to public green space, abundant green space being mostly private.  Geographically and culturally targeted interventions are needed, support for carers and access to rural facilities
